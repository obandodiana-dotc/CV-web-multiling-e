## 🚀 Key Technical Features

The underlying code structure of this CV page showcases the following front-end development skills:

* **Framework-Less Development (Vanilla JS):** All DOM manipulation, content injection, and internationalization (i18n) logic are implemented using pure JavaScript, without reliance on libraries like React, Vue, or jQuery.
* **Internationalization (i18n):** Implemented a dynamic content switching system based on a JavaScript `DATA` object, allowing the user to change the entire page content (ES, EN, DE) instantly without a page reload.
* **Advanced CSS Styling:** Features a modern Dark Mode design, subtle background effects (radial gradients), avatar shimmer animations, and a sticky navigation header that changes style on scroll.
* **Mobile-First & Responsive Design:** Utilizes extensive custom `@media queries` and flexible layouts (Flexbox/Grid) to ensure the design adapts seamlessly across all devices.
* **Code Quality:** Use of CSS variables (`:root`) to define colors and a clear structure for easy maintenance and potential future theme toggling (Light/Dark mode).
